* Need to apply the same operation to every level
* If it works on one level, it should work on every level
* So, design it to:
	* look into the child node on the right (cdr of node)
	* If the child node is not null, pass the node through
	* If it is null, print the current car, then if the second child node isn't null, pass it through
	* Otherwise, you've reached the end a branch

* first node in a list is greater than the second and less than the third
* if second node isn't empty, we should pass it to IOT
* If it is empty, we should cons the first node, then pass the third node to IOT
